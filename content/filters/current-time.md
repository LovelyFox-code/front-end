You can add current time, date, day of the week to any filter.

{{< /blogsection >}}


The process looks like this: 

- You describe your ideas;
- We discuss everything;
- I work on the filter;
- I send a filter testing link, so you can try it on;
- You approve it;
- I send you the files.


You will get:

- Filter file;
- Filter icon;
- Instructions on how to upload a filter.
